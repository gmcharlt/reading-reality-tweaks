# Functionality Plugin Template

This is a basic template for your functionality plugin, setting the stage for you to make changes to your site without risking losing your changes when things get updated.

This theme is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/theukedge/functionality-plugin).

## How to use this plugin

There are very elaborate instructions on my "[Putting Things Where They Belong](http://www.doitwithwp.com/putting-things-where-they-belong/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=content)" tutorial, but in short:

* Open functionality-plugin.php
* Edit the plugin headers to suit your own situation
* Upload to your site
* Activate

At first, nothing will be any different, because there are no customisations. This is where you come in. Start adding new functionality, styles and customisations to suit your needs.
